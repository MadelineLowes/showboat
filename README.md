## Description
This application allows users to search any movie or TV show and discover quickly which streaming platform it is available on, navigate to the streaming location, and see information about the production. Users can also save movies or shows to a watchlist which they can edit to remove items. The API used is called WatchMode.

## Installation
Deployed application link: https://madelinelowes.github.io/showboat/

## Usage
To use the application, users can type in a movie or show title into the search bar. If available, the movie/show information will be populated on the results page, along with other movie/show suggestions. To access the streaming platform where the user's movie/show is on, the user can click the poster image and will be redirected to the movie/show on that particular platform.

If a movie is a favourite or should be saved for later, users can click the heart icon on the results page and the movie/show will be added to the liked list, which can be accessed by clicking the heart icon on the home page. To return to the homepage, users can click the boat icon in the top left corner of the screen next to "Showboat" in the header.

One drawback about using this API is that the API key maxes out relatively quickly, though it resets every month. If users are looking to do some testing or look at the code, they can use these extra codes provided here in the event that their current key stops working.
